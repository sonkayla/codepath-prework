## Introduce Yourself

### App Description

This app presents a form that provides text fields for the the user to type in their first name, last name, and school name.

To build on, the user can provide the information of how many pets that they have by incrementing or decrementing the number through the stepper. The user can also turn on and off the switch which states if it is true of false that the user would want more pets. Once the user inputs all the information, they can click the introduce button to present an introduction of themselves as an alert.
